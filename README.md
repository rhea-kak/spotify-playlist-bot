# spotify-playlist-bot

This Bot allows you to automatically save your "Discover Weekly" playlists that are generated by spotify, but disappear/get refreshed every week. It will automatically add the playlist with it's date to your library so you don't have to worry about forgetting to save it and can go back and jam at all times :)

You can use a task scheduler to set this script to run weekly!
