# spotify-playlist-bot

A bot that leverages the Spotify API to allow you to automatically save your "Discover Weekly" playlists that are generated by Spotify. These playlists are awesome, but unfortunately disappear/get refreshed every week. 

This will add the playlist (with it's date) to your library so you don't have to worry about forgetting to save it, and can go back and jam to all your personally curated picks at all times! 

Follow instructions in the secrets_template file to fill out your own authorization information.

You can use a task scheduler to set this script to run weekly. Happy listening :)
